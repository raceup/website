To obtain greater downforce, in addition to the use of the front and rear wings, it is important to carefully study the bottom of the car in order to have a faster airflow than the flow in and out of the car itself.

This is achieved by using the properties of the Venturi effect, whereby the pressure of a fluid current (in our case, air) increases with decreasing speed.

This property is exploited in particular by the extractor to produce aerodynamic load from the outgoing flows from the bottom of the car, creating a low pressure area below the car thanks to its particular "upside down" shape, which increases in volume along its extension.

The slope of the diffuser is very important and must be studied so that the flow of air does not separate abruptly from the top and sides.
