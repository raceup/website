The Engine department deals with several aspects that can be summarized in four macro areas: fluid dynamics, internal transmission, cooling and auxiliary systems.

In the first area, the main objective is to maximize the power and torque that can be expressed by the engine, currently a Honda CBR 600 RR. In particular, the philosophy on which the studies of the intake and exhaust systems and of the engine timing have been focused, has been to obtain a nearly constant torque as the rotation speed varies to always express the engine performance at best. To do this we start from simple paper and pen counts, then move on to Matlab models for timing, CFD to convey the air to the engine in the best possible way and minimizing all losses, up to a one-dimensional model that allows you to simulate the engine fluid dynamic operation with a 1.1% error compared to the test bench.

The internal transmission has the task of transmitting the torque from the crankshaft to the pinion, trying to maximize the mechanical efficiency and contain the weights. The organs on which we intervene most are the gearbox (adapted to the requirements of the Formula SAE), the slipper clutch and the pinion. In collaboration with the structures departments and vehicles dynamics, we try to transmit as much torque as possible to the wheels through the crown, self-locking differential and axle shafts.

In cooling, the water and oil temperatures are managed, so as to maximize performance without compromising reliability. Different layouts of the cooling system are evaluated and studied, also to meet the needs of the aerodynamic department.

Finally, they are part of the Auxiliary Systems, indispensable components such as those of the petrol line and the air line for the transmission and clutch actuation systems.

After simulation, design and construction of the components, the test bench is first tested (engine map, ignition advance, torque curve) and then on the track where, through targeted tests, analysis of acquisitions and changes in the ECU, we try to increase the performance of the car.
